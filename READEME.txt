1. This simulation could be run in Eclipse since it's written in Java. 
   So if you don't have Ecllipse installed in your PC, you can just simple go to Eclipse website 
   to download it. Check the link below and choose "Eclipse IDE for Java Developers".
   
   https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/

2. Beofre use eclipse, we need to download Java SE Development Kit 8 Downloads to build up
   a proper environment. Just simply download "Java SE Development Kit 8u40" and install.

3. After we successfully install two softwares above, we can start to run simulation
   by using Eclipse.

4. Here is a short tutorial to teach you how to use Eclipse from the first step to run the Hello_World program.

5. Please use the Applicaitn.java attached in the package "Project3" All the sorce code are
   in it. When we start to use eclipse to run the simulation, you have to change the 
   name of .txt file you are going to read in line 10. By default, it will read "FIFO_INPUT_16.txt".
   
   The first string means which algorithm we are going to use.
   The second string means this is input file.
   The third integer means how large the frame size will be. 
   
   Remember to put all the input.txt file under the java project directory when running the simulation.
   Otherwise, the source cannot read the input.txt file correctly.

P.S: If you have any questions or difficulty of running my code, please let me know in camino. 

Have a nice day! Wish you my best!
